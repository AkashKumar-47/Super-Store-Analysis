     - Developed a map visualization showing state-wise sales with bubble size representing sales volume.
     - Built a stacked area chart for monthly trends in sales and profit.
     - Designed a donut chart for sales by segment, region, and payment mode.
     - Added KPI cards for key metrics (sales, orders, profit, average shipping days).
   - **Filters and Slicers:**  
     - Incorporated slicers for region and time (years and quarters).
     - Integrated a bookmark to clear all filters, enhancing user navigation.
     
3. **Analysis & Refinement:**  
   - Iteratively refined the dashboard based on testing, feedback, and exploratory data analysis.
