The goal of this project is to provide an interactive dashboard that gives comprehensive insights into the sales performance of the SuperStore. The dashboard helps in understanding: Sales trends over time, Performance across different categories and shipping modes.


## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to provide an interactive dashboard that gives comprehensive insights into the SuperStore Sales dataset and offers a short‐term sales forecast to guide business planning. The dashboard helps in understanding:

- Sales trends over time.
- Performance across different categories, sub-categories, and shipping modes.
- Geographic distribution of sales using interactive maps.
- Detailed KPI cards displaying sales, orders, profit, and average shipping days.
- Comparative analysis based on segments, regions, and payment modes.
- Short‐term 15‐day forecast to estimate upcoming sales volume and potential demand.

## Key Questions & KPIs
The dashboard is built around answering the following strategic questions:
- **Sales by Category and Sub-Category:**  
  How do different product categories perform in terms of overall sales and profit?
- **Shipping Modes:**  
  Which shipping modes are most frequently used, and how do they influence delivery times?
- **Geographic Insights:**  
  Which states have higher sales volumes and how is the geographical spread?
- **Time-Series Analysis:**  
  What are the monthly sales and profit trends over the years?
- **Customer Segmentation:**  
  How do sales vary across different segments and regions?

## Key Performance Indicators include:
- **Total Sales:** Overall revenue from the dataset.
- **Total Orders:** Count of orders placed.
- **Profit:** Net profit after accounting for returns and expenses.
- **Average Shipping Days:** Efficiency in the shipping process.

## Process of the Project
The project followed these steps:

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**  
   - Imported the SuperStore Sales dataset into Power BI.
   - Cleaned data to handle missing values, data type conversions, and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:**
   - Identified high‐level trends in sales, profit, and quantity.
   - Segmented data by region, category, sub‐category, and shipping mode.
3. **Dashboard Development in Power BI:**  
   - Visualizations:
       - **Sales by Category & Sub‐Category:** Compare performance across product lines.
       - **Map Visualization:** Illustrates state‐level sales with bubble sizes representing sales volume.
       - **Monthly Sales & Profit:** Displays year‐over‐year performance.
       - **Sales by Segment, Region, Payment Mode:** Quickly assess relative contribution of each slice.
       - **KPI Cards:** Show top metrics like total sales, orders, profit, and average shipping days.
       - **15‐Day Sales Forecast:** Uses built‐in Power BI forecasting to predict short‐term sales.
    - Filters and Slicers:
       - Region slicer for geographic focus.
       - Year & Quarter slicer for time‐based analysis.
       - A bookmark button to Clear All Filters and return to default view.   
3. **Analysis & Refinement:**  
   - Iteratively refined the dashboard based on testing, feedback, and exploratory data analysis.
   - Validated insights through cross-checking with the raw dataset.

## Project Insights
Key insights derived from the analysis include:
- **Category Performance:**  
  Certain product categories and sub-categories drove higher sales, indicating a focus area for marketing and inventory decisions.
- **Shipping Efficiency:**  
  Analysis of shipping modes revealed how operational choices influence the average shipping days.
- **Geographical Trends:**  
  Sales varied significantly across different states. Areas with higher sales volumes could signal regional preferences or market opportunities.
